# DropMe
# Capstone-Project 
### George Brown College
### Description :
Dropme is a blockchain-based city-to-city Carpooling platform that will work on a decentralized network to minimize the extra cost accrued due to the presence of multiple intermediates. 
Ridesharing is a solution for drivers to share journeys with other riders, which not only saves money on transportation but also reduces traffic congestion. Existing ridesharing solutions are dependent on third parties, making them vulnerable to single point of failure and denial of service assaults. It also presents issues of privacy. The proposed solution is to use blockchain technology. This document intends to connect the smart city idea by presenting the smart transportation system and investigating the possibilities of using blockchain technology into ride-sharing services. A distributed, decentralised ledger using blockchain technology enables safe peer-to-peer transactions without the presence of a third party.
